Positioned side by side in the center of the page inside .container-1.

After the search bar, weather data is shown below in .container-2, styled like a card with a soft white background and smooth animation.

Responsive Layout:
The layout adjusts to different screen sizes and remains centered vertically and horizontally.

Smooth Animation:
Weather details fade in with a subtle upward motion for a modern UI feel.

 Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling and animations

Ready for JavaScript to dynamically update weather info (e.g., using a weather API)
